# Why I Made This
<p> For this coding challenge, I created a Website Design System that could be used to style a webpage. I found an image that I found appealing and used a color identifier to determine the hex code for each color. Then, I found the fonts that I liked and added them to my Website Design System. Creating this Website Design System helped me better understand block and inline elements, as well as, using other sources to find hex codes and fonts.</p>
